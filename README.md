# What is git?
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## What is a version control system?
* It allows us to save many versions of a same proyect using checkpoint
* It save us memory
* It comes to solve the problem of saving multiple files for one proyect to have checkpoints

## Git disadvantages
* It works locally. Meaning that working in a group project just with git unpractical.
* If we lose or damage the computer where the project is we can lose all the change log.

# What is github?
* Is the largest development platform
* It's a Cloud Hosting & collaboration provider
* It is a git repository hosting
* It come to solve the git's problems

Github and Git aren't the same thing, but they complement each other

# How does it work?
Whenever we use git, it is created a working directory and a hidden folder called __.git__ , where the version control system works.

## Basic concepts
* Working directory: Folder where git is managed
* Commit: files and folder snapshot. It registers the changes
* Branch: Order set of commits

# Git instalation
Check [website](https://git-scm.com/)

# Git basic commands
* **git init**: To initialize repository
* **git status**: Gives a description about the project files and the current branch. It also give us information about the current folder files, if they are in the worging directory or the staging area
* **git add file_name**: It add file_name to the staging area. If we use a point (__.__) instead of a file name, it adds all the current folder files to the staging area 
* **git commit -m "message"**: Moves files from staging area to the repository with an attached massage
* **git config --global user.email "email"**: It allow us to configure with which mail we identify ourself inside git
* **git config --global user.name "name"**: It allow us to configure with which name we identify ourself inside git
* **git config user.email**: It gives us the current user's mail
* **git config user.name**: It gives us the current user's name
* **git log**: It give us information about all the logs of the current branch
* **git checkout commitId_or_branch**: It allow us to restore to a previous version or to move to other branch
* **git branch**: It give us the names of all branches
* **git branch new_branch_name**: It creates another branch
* **git checkout -b new_branch_name**: It create a new branch and move the head to it.
* **git merge other_branch**: It adds all the changes of other_branch to the current branch
* **git switch branch_name**:  To creat a move to other branch
* **git switch -c branch_name**:  To create a new branch.
* **git ls-files**: To see files that are considered in the current branch for, at least, the staging area
* **git add**: Remove from stage area all the files deleted in the working directory

## Delete data
* **git rm file_name**: To delete file from staging area (It should have been deleted from the working directory too)
* **git clean -d**: To delete unstaged files from working directory
* **git clean -df**: To delete unstaged files from working directory
* **git clean -dn**: To show unstaged files from working directory and the computer

## Untrack change
* In the working directory for one file: You can just to the latest commit state for an specific file by using the command: **git checkout file_name** or **git restore file_name** 
* In the working directory for multiple files: **git checkout** or **git restore .**

# Head
* Head: Last commit we are pointing
* Detahced Head: Special branch that is created when we switch move the head to an specific commit. This special branch is erased whenever we change branch, the only way to save it is to create a new branch
